- **Developers:** Hung Pham, Hung Ngo

### Back-end Description

This back-end, built with Spring Boot and MongoDB, handles all our application's data processing, API management, and integration with the front-end. We constantly evolve our back-end architecture and functionalities to align with customer needs and demands in our commitment to provide the best user experience.

### Key Features

#### RESTful API Endpoints
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Our REST API is designed to handle data requests efficiently. It supports standard operations like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowing users to interact with our database securely and intuitively.
- **Scalable and Secure**: With Spring Boot, we've ensured that our API is not only scalable to handle increasing loads but also secure using JWT token to protecting user data and interactions.
- **JSON Responses**: The API communicates using JSON, ensuring lightweight data exchange and compatibility with various frontend technologies.

#### WebSocket Endpoints
- **STOMP Over WebSocket**: We utilize STOMP as a simple, lightweight messaging protocol that works on top of WebSocket. This enables our application to handle messaging semantics like subscribe, unsubscribe, send, and receive, providing a flexible way to manage real-time data flow.
- **Message Broker Integration**: To efficiently route messages between the server and connected clients, we've integrated a message broker into our WebSocket implementation. This ensures smooth and scalable handling of messages, even when the number of concurrent users grows.
- **Real-Time Data Exchange**: This setup is perfect for features that require live data updates, such as notifications, real-time analytics, or live chats. The message broker efficiently handles the distribution of messages, ensuring timely and reliable data delivery to the appropriate recipients.

### Package Structure

Our application is structured into several packages, each with its specific responsibility:

- `main/java/com/team08/csci205_final_project`: Root package containing all application logic.
  - `advice`: Classes for logging and exception handling from controller.
  - `config`: Configuration classes for setting up application parameters and settings.
  - `controller`: Controllers managing HTTP request handling and response generation.
  - `event`: For event handling and related application logic.
  - `exception`: Custom exception classes and exception management.
  - `model`: Core classes representing application data and application logic.
    - `Auth`: Classes specific to authentication processes.
    - `DTO`: Data Transfer Objects for efficient data encapsulation.
      - `Job`, `Provider`, `User`: DTOs for respective entities.
    - `Job`, `Provider`, `Transaction`, `User`: Model classes for these entities.
  - `repository`: Interfaces for data access using MongoDB.
  - `security`: Security configurations and security exception handling.
  - `service`: Service classes containing the application's logic.

- `resources`: Non-code configurations.

- `test`: Contains all test code, mirroring the structure of the `main` directory for comprehensive testing.
  - `controller`, `repository`, `security`, `service`: Test packages corresponding to their respective application components.

### Third-Party Libraries

We've utilized the following third-party libraries, which are not part of the standard Java API:

1. **Spring Boot (version 3.1.5)** - A powerful framework that simplifies the development, deployment, and operation of Spring applications. [Spring Boot Main Page](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
2. **MongoDB** - Our choice for the database, MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. [MongoDB Main Page](https://www.mongodb.com/)
3. **Lombok** - Lombok is a Java library that helps to reduce boilerplate code. It automatically generates getters, setters, constructors, and other common code during the compile-time process. [Lombok Main Page](https://projectlombok.org)
4. **jjwt-api (Version 0.11.5)** - We use `jjwt-api` for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), crucial for secure authentication and communication in our application. [jjwt-api GitHub](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt)
5. **Springdoc (Version 2.1.0)** - This library makes it easy to create and maintain accurate API documentation, which is essential for both internal development and external API consumers. [Springdoc GitHub](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)


### How to run it

Follow these steps to set up the back-end of our project on your local machine:

1. **Navigate to the back-end directory**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Change to the back-end directory of the project:
      ```
      cd path/to/csci205_final_project/backend
      ```
      Replace `path/to` with the actual path to your project.

2. **Build and run the project**:
    - Use gradle wrapper to build the code:
      ```
      ./gradlew build
      ```
    - Run it:
      ```
      ./gradlew run
      ```

3. **Verify the server is running**:
    - Check the terminal output to confirm the server is running. You can access the [API Documentation](http://localhost:8080/docs/api/ui) for front-end developers and also use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints.
